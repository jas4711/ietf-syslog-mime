      <t>The syslog protocol is used to convey event notification
      messages across the network.  This document specify a stored
      format for Syslog information. This is important to ensure
      proper operation of the common log processing toolchain.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Background">

	<t>
		The <xref target="RFC5424">syslog</xref> protocol
		specify the wire format of standardized syslog, but it
		does not specify a format for stored data.  This
		document describe how syslog messages are stored in
		text files in a format that is close to the
		on-the-wire format.
	</t>
	<t>
		There are two main issues that this document
		addresses: the important information on syslog
		priority and facility is usually discarded in existing
		implementations and there are no common rules for
		control character escaping provided.  This document
		offers guidelines for both.
	</t>
	<t>
		An important motivation for this document is the
		emergency of multi-line syslog messages. Traditionally,
		a syslog message fit into a single line. While 
		<xref target="RFC5424"/> supports multi-line messages,
		the usual text processing tool chain (tools like
		grep, sed, tr, and many others) does not properly handle
		multi-line log messages. This document specifies a format
		that continues to work with the tool chain but also
		permits to process multi-line log messages.
	</t>
	<t>
		An important example for multi-line log messages are JAVA
		stack traces and some forms of JSON-encoded messages in
		widespread use.
	</t>
	<t>
		The encoding outlined in this document can be used
		both with legacy syslog as described in <xref
		target="RFC3164" /> and standardized <xref
		target="RFC5424"/> syslog.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Syslog Format">
    <t>
		The textual representation is on-the-wire format as
		documented in <xref target="RFC5424" /> except for the
		control character handling described below.  The PRI
		field MUST be included inside the textual
		representation, as discussed in <xref target="RFC5424"
		/>.  The ABNF rule for on-the-wire syslog messages is
		SYSLOG-MSG.
    </t>
    <t>
		Each syslog message MUST be delimited by the operating
		system line delimiter. This usually is LF or CRLF. We do
		not demand a specific line delimiter because that would
		conflict with the goal of supporting operating system
		text processing toolchains.
    </t>
    <t>
    		[Alternatively, we may require [CR]/LF, this should be
		good for the majority of cases and probably all where
		the tool chain argument applies.]
    </t>
    <t>
		Control characters inside the textual representation
		MUST be escaped. Characters %x00 to %x1F and %x7f MUST
		be encoded as "#ooo" where "ooo" is the threee-digit
		octal representation of the characters' numerical
		code. The character "#" (%x23) MUST be encoded as
		"##". Please note that this encoding is consistent
		with what many implementations already use. We have
		selected this encoding in the hope that it be the
		least intrusive one.
    </t>
    <t>
    		[Alternatively, we may JSON control character encoding.
		This has become very popular and possibly is a better choice.
		Most importantly, it would facilitate text-tools to convert
		log records into JSON -- e.g. to submit them to
		ElasticSearch or other REST APIs.]

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>The registration template as documented in <xref
      target="RFC4288"/> follows:</t>

      <t>Type name: text</t>

      <t>Subtype name: syslog</t>

      <t>Required parameters: None</t>

      <t>Optional parameters: The "charset" parameter MAY be used as
      discussed in <xref target="RFC4288"/>, and is normally
      UTF-8.</t>

      <t>Encoding considerations: 8bit, to preserve UTF-8 data.</t>

      <t>Security considerations: Syslog information may be security
      relevant, and could warrant integrity and even confidentiality
      protection.  Solutions to this problem is outside the scope of
      this document, but we note the existence of <xref
      target="RFC3156">PGP/MIME</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5751">S/MIME</xref>.</t>

      <t>Interoperability considerations:</t>

      <t>Published specification: This document and <xref
      target="RFC5424"/>.</t>
